        <h2>Investing in Yourself: College</h2>
        <p>Going to college and receiving a degree is an important, though unfortunately expensive, investment in one’s future. Attending college can open doors, provide connections, and impart experience, but paying for it often prevents people who would otherwise benefit for attending from doing so.</p>

      <div id="no2" style="display: none;"><h2></h2>
       
        <p>Knowing how to receive aid, what type of aid is out there, and how to spend it properly are ways to work to reduce the total cost of college education and put one a path to more stable financial future.</p>

        <h2></h2><p>With so much social pressure to consume mindlessly (think about how many advertisements you’re exposed to each day), budgets are necessary for proper financial management, no matter how basic they may seem. A budget, even if just a rough overview, provides a plan for your income and gives you a tool for seeing how well you did financially each period (usually every month). You don’t have to track every single dollar (unless you want to!), but an overall picture of where your money is going is invaluable. 

</p><p>Not budgeting can hurt you in many ways. These include</p>

      <div id="no4"><h2></h2>
<ul>

<li>Can lead to not paying bills on time or not having enough to pay when they come due
<ul>
<li>This can cause many issues, such as late fees and penalties, a ding to credit score), to more serious things such as garnished wages (taking a percentage of your income each pay period), losing your car (repossession), losing your rental property (eviction), and even losing your house (foreclosure). </li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Getting into more debt
<ul>
<li>Debt when used to finance consumable goods (things which do not gain in value over time) is bad and should be avoided if possible. Not having a budget increases the likelihood you’ll need to take on debt to finance your lifestyle. In addition, it also prevents you from getting out of debt (which as you’ll see, often becomes worse over time because of compounding interest).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Failure to meet goals
<ul>
<li>One of the main goals of budgeting is to create a way to reach your future goals. You may want to save for a trip to Florida, save for a child’s education, or purchase a big ticket item. Creating a budget in line with your future goals creates the most forward path to getting your desires.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You may feel budgeting is stressful, and it might be at first, but think about it: How much more stressful is it to fix a financial problem after it’s already occurred? By creating a budget (and trying to stick to it!), you’re already setting yourself apart from other people who wander through life with no real financial plan. </li>
</ul>

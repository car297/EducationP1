        <h2>Debt Relief Options</h2>
        <p>In addition to repayment options, there may be opportunities to delay (or in some cases, even cancel) some out your debt repayments. Different categories include:</p>

      <div id="no2" style="display: none;"><h2>Types of Student Loan Debt Relief</h2>
        <ul>
<li>Deferment: This is a temporary postponement of making repayments because of a certain situation, such as returning to school, becoming unemployed, or entering military service. It is not an automatic process; it is the borrower’s responsibility to contact his or her loan servicer and request a deferment. The federal government pays the interest during deferment periods for some loans (e.g. direct subsidized and Perkins), but the borrower has to pay the interest for others (e.g. direct unsubsidized, PLUS, PLUS Parent). </li>
<li>Forbearance: It is a postponement of repayments for up to 12 months at time; it can be done for up to 3 years. It is similar to deferment, except accrued interest is always paid by the borrower, who can pay additional interest during the forbearance period or allow it to be added to their balance and capitalized (the one exception is for Perkins loans, where the interest, while added, is not capitalized. This prevents the interest added during forbearance from compounding over time).</li>
<li>Loan forgiveness: This allows the borrower to cancel a portion or even all of their student loan in exchange for some kind of service, such as becoming a teacher or public service worker.</li>
<li>Loan cancelation or discharge: This occurs when the borrower is completely unable to pay back the loan, such as after becoming permanently and fully disabled or after death, or when the borrower enters into a particular profession, such as teacher, librarian, or law enforcement (not all loans qualify for the latter type of cancelation. Check with your loan provider). </li>
<li>Consolidation: This type does not reduce your debt (in fact, it raises the total amount you owe most often), but it can reduce your monthly payments. Loan consolidation combines several loans into one. Private loans cannot be consolidated per se, but qualified borrowers (based on their creditworthiness) can take out personal loans to pay off student loan debt. Sometimes it can be done at a lower interest rate, but one should not that the capitalized interest on a student loan is now converted into principal in such a situation and thus cannot be deducted on the borrower’s taxes.</li></ul>

        <h2>Consequences of Not Paying</h2><p>Interest paid on student loans is tax deductible, but repayment of principal is not. The good thing is that student loan money is not taxed when disbursed.</p>
<p>If you are tempted to just not pay your student loans without taking the correct steps (such as through a new repayment plan or a debt relief plan), you are just hurting yourself. Defaulting on student debt affects your credit, which can prevent you from purchasing a home, car, or opening lines of credit. </p>
<p>If you fail to pay make payments for 270 days in a row, you loan goes into default, and you are required to pay back the balance immediately. The federal government can sue over unpaid federal loans and take away all state and federal tax refunds, garnish your wages (take away a share of your wages each month), and pay collection fees. You also lose the chance of taking out any student loans in the future and become ineligible to receive federal benefits. You lose future eligibility for deferments, and, if you wait long enough, can even have your Social Security payments garnished. You will likely even be harassed by collection agencies as well. </p>

      <div id="no4"><h2></h2>
<p>The moral of the story: If you find yourself in trouble, reach out to your loan servicer (the entity which actually collects the payments) and enroll in a new repayment plan or seek debt relief, and never ignore warnings from them!</p>

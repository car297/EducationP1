        <h2>Types of Financial Aid</h2>
        <p>Not all financial aid is the same, far from it. Grants and scholarships are the gold standard. Work-study is under those, and under that are loans. Even within these categories are great variation.</p>

      <div id="no2" style="display: none;"><h2>Grants and Scholarships</h2>
        <p>Grants and scholarships are financial awards that do not have to be paid back. These can come from several sources, including the school itself; federal, state, and local governments; and private organizations. Some are merit-based and are awarded as a result of academic, athletic, and community achievements of the student. Others are need-based, in which that aid is awarded strictly on the financial need of the student. Some are lottery-based and are essentially awarded by pure chance as a result of the applicant entering her name in a competition. </p>
<p>Receiving as much money from grants and scholarships should be the goal of every student. Unfortunately, these are often difficult to find and many are for relatively low amounts (but hey, $100 can still buy a textbook!). Don’t get too discouraged if you receive rejections for scholarships you apply for; keep looking for those opportunities!</p>
<p>Some notable government-provided grants and scholarships include</p>
<ul>
<li>Pell grants: They are given to needy students. The maximum amount given rises over time, and is currently just over $6,100 per year. However, most awardees receive something less than that</li>
<li>Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG): Given to the neediest students and has a maximum award of $4,000</li>
<li>Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants: Are given to undergraduate, graduate, and post-baccalaureate students who will teach K-12 education in needy communities</li>
<li>Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants: Given to students whose parents died while serving in the US military during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan after September 11, 2001. You must not be eligible for a Pell Grant on the basis of your Expected Family Contribution </li>
<li>GI Bill: Given to those who have served a set period of time in the US military. Maximum awards are based off the tuition of the most expensive public university in your state. Recipients can apply these awards towards tuition of private universities with higher tuition. Recipients also receive a basic housing allowance (BAH) based on the zip code of the college.</li>
<li>Reserve Officers Training Corps: Pays for tuition of students who pledge to serve in the US military after graduation</li></ul>
<p>Private organizations can also provide grants and scholarships which often award them on the basis of academic achievement (often they require submission of essay and grade point averages), community involvement and service, career and study interest, demographic factors, among others. </p>
<p>Colleges and universities also can provide their own scholarships. These include academic scholarships, usually for performance during high school, as well as athletic scholarships. The latter require recipients to play throughout their college career for continued eligibility. Most grants often require a minimum GPA to be maintained during enrollment, though some, especially need-based grants, only require the recipient to remain in good academic standing.  </p>
<p>Employers, either the student’s or guardian’s, may be a source of scholarships as well.</p>
<p>As with anything, beware of scams and fraudulent offers. With the exception of submitting the CSS-Profile, do not pay for applying to scholarships and grants. Remember, you should expect for them to pay you money (or at least your school), not the other way around. Be careful also with giving out sensitive information, such as your social security number.</p>

        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p>Becoming employed is another way to you can be offered financial aid. </p>
<p>Students needing financial assistance can be offered the Federal Work-Study program (FWS). Students must submit the FAFSA to be eligible. </p>
<p>This program provides employment opportunities for the students with financial need as the federal government pays institutions to fund jobs that otherwise may not be available to all students. </p>

      <div id="no4"><h2>Loans</h2>
<p>No part of financial aid today is as stressful and controversial as student loans. Knowing how these loans can differ from each other will take you far in starting off on the right financial footing after college.</p>
<p>Loans are essentially money given by another entity that must be paid back in the future. Student loans allow the borrower, in this case the student, to take out money to pay for college expenses and pay them back after graduation. As we will see, student loans are not all equal, not by any means. Some begin to add interest during school, while others wait until after you graduate (or leave without a degree or drop below a certain amount of credit hours) to begin charging interest. Most student loans require repayment to begin only after you leave college, regardless of whether you graduated. </p>
<p>We’ll start with government-provided student loans. The Federal Direct Loan Program provides low-interest loans (relative to the private market) to students for post-secondary education. These loans can be granted on a need-basis or generally to those who want them (with different implications for their interest rates and accrual periods).</p>
<p>Government need-based:</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct subsidized: The applicant must display financial need and interest does not accrue while you are in college at least half-time. The student begins repayment on these loans after they leave college or stop being a student at least half-time (there is a six-month grace period in which the borrower does not have to make any payments, but interest still accrues). </li>
<li>Perkins: Only given to the neediest students. Like the direct subsidized they are low-interest, and the Perkins loans have a nine-month grace period after graduation or leaving college or dropping below half-time. They also have no origination fee (unlike the direct subsidized, which has a small one). Perkins loans are also offered to graduate students, unlike the subsidized direct loans.</li></ul>
<p>Government general loans</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct unsubsidized: These charge higher interest rates than direct subsidized or Perkins loans, and the interest begins accruing after the first disbursement (when the money is paid to your institution). They, like the Perkins loan, are available to graduate students, and repayment begins after the student leaves college (with a six-month grace period). </li>
<li>Federal Direct Graduate PLUS: These loans are for graduate students and require a credit check to verify the borrower’s creditworthiness. There is no grace period and interest begins to accrue after disbursement, but the borrower can declare a deferral if needed. </li></ul>
<p>Parents can also take up student loans to help their children pay for their education. Parent PLUS loans are for the parents of both graduate and undergraduate students. They are awarded based on the creditworthiness of the parent. They have no grace period, and interest accrues immediately upon disbursement. They also have origination fees.  There is no grace period, but the parents can request deferral of making payments while their child is in school and up to six months after they leave. Parents are solely the ones responsible for paying back this loan. </p>
<p>Federal direct subsidized and unsubsidized have limits to how much the student can borrow (with unsubsidized loans having higher limits than subsidized). PLUS loans have no such limit and borrowers can take out the full cost of attendance. </p>
<p>Another option are private loans, such those from Sallie Mae (not a government agency, unlike similar sounding entities like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae). These loans have higher interest, often require some credit check, and may require a cosigner (even when a cosigner is not required, having one can lower the interest rate and thus the total amount you will have to pay). They also come in fixed and variable rates. Be aware: Variable rate loans often start at deceptively low interest rates, and they will almost certainly rise somewhat from that rate, even if interest rates go down. These loans should be avoided until you have managed to fully use government loans available to you.</p>
<p>As with any money you receive, you should wisely manage any disbursements sent to you directly (this happens if the amount you took out is more than what the school directly charges. This can happen, for example, if you take out loans to cover room and board but live off campus). </p>

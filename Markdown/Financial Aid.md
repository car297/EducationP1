###Investing in Yourself: College###

# Investing in Yourself: College

Going to college and receiving a degree is an important, though unfortunately expensive, investment in one’s future. Attending college can open doors, provide connections, and impart experience, but paying for it often prevents people who would otherwise benefit for attending from doing so.

Knowing how to receive aid, what type of aid is out there, and how to spend it properly are ways to work to reduce the total cost of college education and put one a path to more stable financial future.

###APPLYING###

# Applying for Financial Aid

Applying for Financial Aid
All but the very richest should apply for financial aid. Even if you don’t think you’ll get any, you may be pleasantly surprised! In the United States, applying for financial aid usually begins with filling out the FAFSA (short for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid). The FAFSA is a form created by the US government that asks a series of questions to find out how much financial aid does the student need (unfortunately, often times what you feel you need and what financial aid officers think you need are two different things).

Usually both you and your family will be expected to contribute to your education, with the expected family contribution (EFC) how much your parents or guardians must contribute, and the expected student contribution (ESC) how much you will be expected to contribute (usually schools expect this to be met through summer employment. Work-study awards are counted towards your financial aid award itself).

# Necessary Forms

Factors asked about on the FAFSA include your income, your assets, and your parents’ or guardians’ income and assets (if you are a dependent of them). To fill out the FAFSA, you will need your and your parents W2s (which are forms provided by employers to keep track of how much money an employee has made in a year), bank statements (which keep track of how much you have in your bank account), social security numbers (or resident ID numbers if you are not an American citizen), as well as any other records that you may need to answer its questions.

Signing the FAFSA can be laborious in trying to create the FAFSA ID. If you are a dependent, you need to have that person create a FAFSA ID and sign it to. Especially if you live away from your parents or guardian, try to fill out the FAFSA ahead of the deadline to prevent stressful calls to create or retrieve a FAFSA ID.

Even more laborious and tedious is the CSS-Profile form by the College Board. Fortunately, relatively few schools require it. Most schools that require it are private, elite, and expensive. It should be noted that these schools also provide the best financial aid, so applying to schools that require the CSS-Profile may yield an actual lower cost of attendance.

The CSS-Profile asks for information about parents’ retirement funds, home ownership, businesses owned, etc. This form requires more time to fill out than the FAFSA and also carries a fee for its submission. This form should be completed well in advance of any deadline. In addition, many schools using this form require verification documents (e.g. W2s, tax returns, signature documents) to be submitted to College Board (a program called IDOC). Gathering these documents ahead of time is important to prevent penalties to, or even denials of, financial aid awards.

# [Arrow]
Once you get a financial aid award, you may be disappointed that it is not for a greater amount. You can appeal their decision. Usually this involves a written explanation as to why you need greater aid, along with the provision of supporting documents. Note that some reasons, such as high credit card debt, are usually not reasons accepted by financial aid offices for greater awards.

#Quiz Time
Which is not usually taken into account when a school determines financial aid?
Option 1: Student's assets
Option 2: Parent's salary
Option 3: Student's longterm future earnings potential [Correct]
If Correct: That's correct! Schools do not base financial aid awards off what they they think you may earn years later. Financial aid awards are based primarily on the assets and income of the student and guardian.

 

###TYPES OF FINANCIAL AID###

# Types of Financial Aid

Not all financial aid is the same, far from it. Grants and scholarships are the gold standard. Work-study is under those, and under that are loans. Even within these categories are great variation.

# Grants and Scholarships
Grants and scholarships are financial awards that do not have to be paid back. These can come from several sources, including the school itself; federal, state, and local governments; and private organizations. Some are merit-based and are awarded as a result of academic, athletic, and community achievements of the student. Others are need-based, in which that aid is awarded strictly on the financial need of the student. Some are lottery-based and are essentially awarded by pure chance as a result of the applicant entering her name in a competition.

Receiving as much money from grants and scholarships should be the goal of every student. Unfortunately, these are often difficult to find and many are for relatively low amounts (but hey, $100 can still buy a textbook!). Don’t get too discouraged if you receive rejections for scholarships you apply for; keep looking for those opportunities!

Some notable government-provided grants and scholarships include

*Pell grants: They are given to needy students. The maximum amount given rises over time, and is currently just over $6,100 per year. However, most awardees receive something less than that
*Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG): Given to the neediest students and has a maximum award of $4,000
*Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants: Are given to undergraduate, graduate, and post-baccalaureate students who will teach K-12 education in needy communities
*Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants: Given to students whose parents died while serving in the US military during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan after September 11, 2001. You must not be eligible for a Pell Grant on the basis of your Expected Family Contribution
*GI Bill: Given to those who have served a set period of time in the US military. Maximum awards are based off the tuition of the most expensive public university in your state. Recipients can apply these awards towards tuition of private universities with higher tuition. Recipients also receive a basic housing allowance (BAH) based on the zip code of the college.
*Reserve Officers Training Corps: Pays for tuition of students who pledge to serve in the US military after graduation

Private organizations can also provide grants and scholarships which often award them on the basis of academic achievement (often they require submission of essay and grade point averages), community involvement and service, career and study interest, demographic factors, among others.

Colleges and universities also can provide their own scholarships. These include academic scholarships, usually for performance during high school, as well as athletic scholarships. The latter require recipients to play throughout their college career for continued eligibility. Most grants often require a minimum GPA to be maintained during enrollment, though some, especially need-based grants, only require the recipient to remain in good academic standing.

Employers, either the student’s or guardian’s, may be a source of scholarships as well.

As with anything, beware of scams and fraudulent offers. With the exception of submitting the CSS-Profile, do not pay for applying to scholarships and grants. Remember, you should expect for them to pay you money (or at least your school), not the other way around. Be careful also with giving out sensitive information, such as your social security number.

# Work

Becoming employed is another way to you can be offered financial aid.

Students needing financial assistance can be offered the Federal Work-Study program (FWS). Students must submit the FAFSA to be eligible.

This program provides employment opportunities for the students with financial need as the federal government pays institutions to fund jobs that otherwise may not be available to all students.

# Loans

No part of financial aid today is as stressful and controversial as student loans. Knowing how these loans can differ from each other will take you far in starting off on the right financial footing after college.

Loans are essentially money given by another entity that must be paid back in the future. Student loans allow the borrower, in this case the student, to take out money to pay for college expenses and pay them back after graduation. As we will see, student loans are not all equal, not by any means. Some begin to add interest during school, while others wait until after you graduate (or leave without a degree or drop below a certain amount of credit hours) to begin charging interest. Most student loans require repayment to begin only after you leave college, regardless of whether you graduated.

We’ll start with government-provided student loans. The Federal Direct Loan Program provides low-interest loans (relative to the private market) to students for post-secondary education. These loans can be granted on a need-basis or generally to those who want them (with different implications for their interest rates and accrual periods).

Government need-based:

*Direct subsidized: The applicant must display financial need and interest does not accrue while you are in college at least half-time. The student begins repayment on these loans after they leave college or stop being a student at least half-time (there is a six-month grace period in which the borrower does not have to make any payments, but interest still accrues).
*Perkins: Only given to the neediest students. Like the direct subsidized they are low-interest, and the Perkins loans have a nine-month grace period after graduation or leaving college or dropping below half-time. They also have no origination fee (unlike the direct subsidized, which has a small one). Perkins loans are also offered to graduate students, unlike the subsidized direct loans.

Government general loans

*Direct unsubsidized: These charge higher interest rates than direct subsidized or Perkins loans, and the interest begins accruing after the first disbursement (when the money is paid to your institution). They, like the Perkins loan, are available to graduate students, and repayment begins after the student leaves college (with a six-month grace period).
*Federal Direct Graduate PLUS: These loans are for graduate students and require a credit check to verify the borrower’s creditworthiness. There is no grace period and interest begins to accrue after disbursement, but the borrower can declare a deferral if needed.
Parents can also take up student loans to help their children pay for their education. Parent PLUS loans are for the parents of both graduate and undergraduate students. They are awarded based on the creditworthiness of the parent. They have no grace period, and interest accrues immediately upon disbursement. They also have origination fees. There is no grace period, but the parents can request deferral of making payments while their child is in school and up to six months after they leave. Parents are solely the ones responsible for paying back this loan.

Federal direct subsidized and unsubsidized have limits to how much the student can borrow (with unsubsidized loans having higher limits than subsidized). PLUS loans have no such limit and borrowers can take out the full cost of attendance.

Another option are private loans, such those from Sallie Mae (not a government agency, unlike similar sounding entities like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae). These loans have higher interest, often require some credit check, and may require a cosigner (even when a cosigner is not required, having one can lower the interest rate and thus the total amount you will have to pay). They also come in fixed and variable rates. Be aware: Variable rate loans often start at deceptively low interest rates, and they will almost certainly rise somewhat from that rate, even if interest rates go down. These loans should be avoided until you have managed to fully use government loans available to you.

As with any money you receive, you should wisely manage any disbursements sent to you directly (this happens if the amount you took out is more than what the school directly charges. This can happen, for example, if you take out loans to cover room and board but live off campus).

###STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT###

#Repaying Your Student Loans

Now that you finished your education (hopefully!), it’s time to begin repaying any loans you took out during that time. For student loans there are different types of repayment plans (check with your student loan servicer to see which they provide). Here are a summary of some of them:

#Repayment Plans

*Standard Repayment Plan: This works for all government direct loans. You pay a fixed amount each month for 10 years, after which the loan is paid off. You can pay back more than the minimum to pay off the loan faster.
Graduated Repayment Plan: This plan may work if you expect your income to rise over time. Repayments start off low and rise over time, generally every two years.
*Extended Repayment Plan: With this plan you have 25 years to pay off your loans, and the payments can be fixed or graduated. While the payments you pay are lower, this plan does increase the total amount of interest you pay. There is also a minimum amount you must have borrowed to qualify for this plan, currently set at $30,000.
*Income-Based Repayment Plan: These plans only are allowed if the borrower faces a certain amount of financial hardship. It sets an upper limit of what each monthly payment can be, and if the user satisfactorily makes progress over 25 years, the remaining balance will be canceled.
*Pay-as-you-earn repayment plans: These are essentially the same as Income-Based Repayment Plans, but they are only for federal direct loans and are canceled after 20 years of satisfactory progress rather than 25.
*Income-Contingent Repayment Plan: This is for direct subsidized and unsubsidized borrowers only. Some qualify for this plan even if they do not for the income-based repayment plan. Monthly payments undergo adjustment each year based on income, family size, and the total amount of direct loans. Borrowers under this repayment plan have 25 years to pay off their debt.

#Quiz Time
Which repayment plan usually leads to the lowest amount you will pay over the life of the loan.

Option 1: Standard [Correct]

Option 2: Graduated

Option 3: Extended

If correct: That's correct! Your monthly payments are larger with the standard, but you pay it off sooner. Income-based plans may have lower payments and lower total repayment, but not all are eligible.

###STUDENT LOAN: RELIEF###

#Debt Relief Options

In addition to repayment options, there may be opportunities to delay (or in some cases, even cancel) some out your debt repayments. Different categories include:

#Types of Student Loan Debt Relief
*Deferment: This is a temporary postponement of making repayments because of a certain situation, such as returning to school, becoming unemployed, or entering military service. It is not an automatic process; it is the borrower’s responsibility to contact his or her loan servicer and request a deferment. The federal government pays the interest during deferment periods for some loans (e.g. direct subsidized and Perkins), but the borrower has to pay the interest for others (e.g. direct unsubsidized, PLUS, PLUS Parent).
*Forbearance: It is a postponement of repayments for up to 12 months at time; it can be done for up to 3 years. It is similar to deferment, except accrued interest is always paid by the borrower, who can pay additional interest during the forbearance period or allow it to be added to their balance and capitalized (the one exception is for Perkins loans, where the interest, while added, is not capitalized. This prevents the interest added during forbearance from compounding over time).
*Loan forgiveness: This allows the borrower to cancel a portion or even all of their student loan in exchange for some kind of service, such as becoming a teacher or public service worker.
*Loan cancelation or discharge: This occurs when the borrower is completely unable to pay back the loan, such as after becoming permanently and fully disabled or after death, or when the borrower enters into a particular profession, such as teacher, librarian, or law enforcement (not all loans qualify for the latter type of cancelation. Check with your loan provider).
*Consolidation: This type does not reduce your debt (in fact, it raises the total amount you owe most often), but it can reduce your monthly payments. Loan consolidation combines several loans into one. Private loans cannot be consolidated per se, but qualified borrowers (based on their creditworthiness) can take out personal loans to pay off student loan debt. Sometimes it can be done at a lower interest rate, but one should not that the capitalized interest on a student loan is now converted into principal in such a situation and thus cannot be deducted on the borrower’s taxes.

#Consequences of Not Paying
Interest paid on student loans is tax deductible, but repayment of principal is not. The good thing is that student loan money is not taxed when disbursed.

If you are tempted to just not pay your student loans without taking the correct steps (such as through a new repayment plan or a debt relief plan), you are just hurting yourself. Defaulting on student debt affects your credit, which can prevent you from purchasing a home, car, or opening lines of credit.

If you fail to pay make payments for 270 days in a row, you loan goes into default, and you are required to pay back the balance immediately. The federal government can sue over unpaid federal loans and take away all state and federal tax refunds, garnish your wages (take away a share of your wages each month), and pay collection fees. You also lose the chance of taking out any student loans in the future and become ineligible to receive federal benefits. You lose future eligibility for deferments, and, if you wait long enough, can even have your Social Security payments garnished. You will likely even be harassed by collection agencies as well.

#[ARROW]
The moral of the story: If you find yourself in trouble, reach out to your loan servicer (the entity which actually collects the payments) and enroll in a new repayment plan or seek debt relief, and never ignore warnings from them!

#Quiz Time
When does your loan go into default?

Option 1: 180 days after last payment

Option 2: 270 days after last payment [Correct]

Option 3: 365 days after last payment

If correct: That's correct! Your loan officially goes into defauly after 270 days of no pyaments unless otherwise stated.

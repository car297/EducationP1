###What is a Budget?###

#What is a Budget?
A budget is a plan to spend your money. It is based on how much money you make (income, or money in), how much you spend (expenses, or money out), and how much you save (savings, or money for later). Budgets can be detailed or broad, comprehensive or specific to a certain area of your financial life.

There are many ways to create a budget: You can make one on paper, use spreadsheets, create one through software (such as through Liquify), or have one professionally managed for you.


#Why You Need a Budget
Budgeting often carries a negative feeling, similar to diet or exercise plans. Few people, if any, look forward towards creating a budget, let alone trying to stay within a budget and making adjustments.

But like making good choices for your physical health, budgeting is good for your financial well-being.


With so much social pressure to consume mindlessly (think about how many advertisements you’re exposed to each day), budgets are necessary for proper financial management, no matter how basic they may seem. A budget, even if just a rough overview, provides a plan for your income and gives you a tool for seeing how well you did financially each period (usually every month). You don’t have to track every single dollar (unless you want to!), but an overall picture of where your money is going is invaluable.

Not budgeting can hurt you in many ways. These include

*Can lead to not paying bills on time or not having enough to pay when they come due
**This can cause many issues, such as late fees and penalties, a ding to credit score), to more serious things such as garnished wages (taking a percentage of your income each pay period), losing your car (repossession), losing your rental property (eviction), and even losing your house (foreclosure).

*Getting into more debt
**Debt when used to finance consumable goods (things which do not gain in value over time) is bad and should be avoided if possible. Not having a budget increases the likelihood you’ll need to take on debt to finance your lifestyle. In addition, it also prevents you from getting out of debt (which as you’ll see, often becomes worse over time because of compounding interest).

*Failure to meet goals
**One of the main goals of budgeting is to create a way to reach your future goals. You may want to save for a trip to Florida, save for a child’s education, or purchase a big ticket item. Creating a budget in line with your future goals creates the most forward path to getting your desires.

*You may feel budgeting is stressful, and it might be at first, but think about it: How much more stressful is it to fix a financial problem after it’s already occurred? By creating a budget (and trying to stick to it!), you’re already setting yourself apart from other people who wander through life with no real financial plan.

#Quiz Time
When should you definitely not take on debt?

Option 1: To finance purchases of consummable goods [Correct]

Option 2: To invest in things such as education

Option 3: To finance a home purchase

If correct: That's correct! You should never take on debt to finance consummable things (like food and entertainment).

###CREATING A BUDGET###

#Gather Information
The first step to creating a budget is to figure out where to get information for tracking your finances.

For example, recent pay stubs may be a good way to get information about your income. Bank and credit card statements are good places to keep track of your expenses.

Past tax returns can give you information about their yearly income as well as give them an idea of what tax deductions and credits they may have (or not have) in the following year.

Keeping track of receipts is a good way to keep track of purchases, especially cash purchases, though this can become tedious to sort and keep track of. Often it can be ok to estimate cash transactions.


#Starting a Budget
Once you have some idea of how you are spending your money, you can begin setting aside money for major expenses. Make sure to set aside funds for your biggest expenses (e.g. your mortgage payment, rent, car payment, utilities, student loans or tuition, etc.).

Next allocate (set aside) money for other, less important things. For example, how much do you want to spend on eating out this month (versus buying and cooking food)? How much do you want to spend on entertainment? Following sections will have tips on deciding how much to spend on different categories; not necessarily how much you should spend on a particular category but tips on how to spend smarter.

You should also decide how much you want to save or invest (more on that later).


#Types of Income and Expenses
There are many types of income and expenses. For example:

##Income

*From jobs that provide salaries. Employers give their employees W2 forms after each year showing how much they made and how much was withheld for taxes.
*From self-employment. Money made from working but not for a formal employer are considered independent contractors. Income from this is still liable for taxes (often more than traditional work, as you must pay both the employer and employee portions of the FICA tax). Any client that pays you more than $600 during the year must provide you a Form 1099-MISC, which details how much the client paid you for your services 
*Investment income. You may earn money from the selling a stock or bond, or you may earn interest or dividend income from an investment.
Gifts
*Legal judgments and settlements
*Some of these income streams, such as gifts and settlements are often non-recurring and relying on these streams for paying expenses, many of which are recurring, can get you into financial hot water.

##Expenses

*Shelter expenses, or where you live. This can be your rent, or if you own a home, your mortgage, maintenance costs, property taxes, and other ownership costs.
*Transportation costs, or how you get from one place to another. If you own a car, this may be your car payment, car registration fees, auto insurance, etc. If you do not own a car, this may be public transportation costs (e.g. bus passes, subway fares, train tickets), taxi and rideshare services (e.g. Uber and Lyft), or gas money for those your carpool with. This category can also include money spent on transportation during trips, especially if you take them regularly (e.g. flights, rental cars, train tickets).
*Utilities, or recurring services that provide necessities or other desired items. These include electricity, water, and gas. Their costs are based on usage during the period (e.g. you are charged for electricity by kilowatt hour and for water by liter).
*Recurring services such as internet, phone, and cable, like utilities, recur every period. Some services cost the same each period (e.g. many internet plans), and some can be usage-based (e.g. a phone plan charging per gigabyte of mobile data used).
*Food. Food can be cooked yourself (purchasing ingredients from grocery stores, farmers’ markets, etc.), or be purchased ready made by restaurants.
*Entertainment, or things you spend on to have fun. These can include theater tickets, movie rentals, video games, going to bars, etc.
*Clothing
*Insurance, such as life insurance and disability insurance.
*Medical expenses, such as health insurance premiums, co-pays, deductibles, and any other out-of-pocket expenses.
*Loan repayments, or paying back what you borrowed plus the interest charged. These can include student loans, personal loans, and credit card payments (especially those for which you do not pay off the balance each month). Home mortgages and car payments are usually put under the housing and transportation categories respectively.
*Taxes, such as federal income and FICA taxes (used to pay for Social Security and Medicare benefits). These are often already taken out of your paycheck each month.

##Savings

*Rainy day fund, or savings to hold you over during a period with no or reduced income (e.g. job loss) or with a major, often unplanned expenses (e.g. medical injury).
*Specific savings goals, including a vacation, education, retirement, etc.

#Consider Opportunity Costs
When you’re making a budget, you should be aware that setting aside money for one thing takes away money from something else. This is called an opportunity cost: the lost benefit of something when you choose its alternative. For example, if you budget more money for food each month, that’s less money you can spend on entertainment. In addition, you can invest your money in the stock market, but you may not be able to access that money quickly if you need it (related to a concept known as liquidity).

Every allocation decision has an opportunity cost. You should work to maximize your net benefits when budgeting: your total satisfaction minus the total opportunity costs.


#Quiz Time!
Which of the following is a type of expense?

Option 1: Rainy Day Fund

Option 2: Housing [Correct]

Option 3: Salary

If correct: That's correct! Housing is an expense for most people, either through mortgage payments or rent. A rainy day fund is a type of savings, and a salary that you receive is a type of income.

###CONTROLLING A BUDGET###

Spend Smarter
Like we covered before, budgets exist to help you achieve goals. While we don’t say spending on one thing over another is inherently good or bad, we do want to point out ways to save and spend smarter on the things we do every day.

We often overspend because of things like social pressure and media glamorization of consumption. Do not let these outside influences dictate your goals: Make your goals your own.


#Facts and Tips
Small ticket items can add up over time and it’s hard to keep track of them. Probably the most common example is buying a $4 coffee each day. If purchased every week day for a year, this can add to over $1000 year. Of course, maybe spending on a coffee each day brings you great benefit and is not something you want to cut out of your budget, and that’s perfectly fine. The only things to realize is that such items do indeed cost more than spending on cheaper alternatives (in this case, brewing coffee at home) and that to afford this you will have to give up spending on something else (the opportunity cost of buying coffee each day).

#[Arrow]
**Subscriptions** can add up quickly, and often times we do not even use what we are paying for (and even sometimes forget we have them). Check regularly to see if there are any subscriptions you can cancel.

#[Arrow]
For **entertainment**, try to find cheaper alternatives and substitutes to what you normally do. In addition, limiting any alcohol consumption often can save you money given its relatively high cost.

Try to limit **electric, gas, and water consumption.** The old advice to turn down the air conditioning in the summer and turn down the heater in the winter are good starts.

When purchasing a **car**, consider a used one, as they are much cheaper than buying one new. Remember to factor in maintenance costs in you consideration, as a dirt cheap car may require more maintenance and have a shorter life than a slightly more expensive used car.

For **trips and vacations**, check different departure and arrival dates to find the cheapest. Also check different airlines and different airports, as some are cheaper than others. Beware of hidden fees, especially on airlines. While the fare may be low, the additional baggage costs may not make the discount worth it. For certain fare classes (often called basic economy), you will not be refunded or rebooked if you miss your flight.

**Clothes** are often marked down at the end of the fashion cycle. If you are not obsessed with following each trend in fashion, waiting for these deeper discounts is a wise move.


#[Arrow]
Shop around as much as you can for deals; you don’t have to visit every single store in the area for the absolute cheapest price, but a little comparing may save a good amount of money. With the internet, comparing prices is easier than ever, but many of us just purchase an item or service from the first place we see (especially on search engines, where ads are often placed first, even though they may not have the best price).

If you use a certain item a lot, consider buying in bulk. Even though each purchase is a larger amount, the per-item cost is often lower.

For sales, pay attention only to sales price, not the original price. If the sales price is still to expensive for you, do not buy it, even if it is nominally marked down by a high percentage.

Clothes are often marked down at the end of the fashion cycle. If you are not obsessed with following each trend in fashion, waiting for these deeper discounts is a wise move.

True or False: Buying a new car is usually a pretty good investment

Option 1: True

Option 2: False [Correct]

If Correct: That's correct! Cars tend to lose value over time

###ADJUSTING YOUR BUDGET###

#Compare Actual to Budgeted
After each period, you need to compare your budget to your actual spending for the period. More than likely, your actual spending will not line up with your budgeted amount. Once your first budget period is over, you should go back to see how well you did in meeting your budget goals.

In some categories, you may have overspent in some categories, while in others you may have underspent.

In addition, you may have received more income than expected (a favorable thing), or received less (unfavorable). If you’re income is unpredictable and varies by a large amount each period, you experience income volatility (don’t worry too much, there are things you can do to help with that!)


#Decide How to Adjust
Once you know how your actual spending compares to your budgeted amounts, you should think about whether your budgeted amounts are appropriate to your current financial situation. If they are, then you should work to keep your spending in that range for the next period. If not, adjust your budget to your needs and goals.

For example, if you budgeted $150 for electricity each month but only spent $110 in the last, it may make sense to adjust the budget to a lower amount for the future, especially if you believe your last month’s electric consumption is typical of your electric consumption.

In contrast, if you spent $200 on entertainment when you budgeted only $100, you should probably examine your spending habits a little more closely. It may be that you think $200 per month is better to spend on entertainment than $100, but you need to find other areas of spending to cut back on.

There are ways to help you stay within your budgeted amounts, such as setting up notifications for when you near your spending limit, putting aside the amount you budget in cash in an envelope and only paying out of that (aka the envelope method), you adding all transactions manually.


#Quiz Time!
Which of the following should you not do when your bugdet and actual spending and income don't match?

Option 1: Wait until the next month to see if it happens again [Correct]

Option 2: Examine your spending to see why you over or underspent

Option 3: Revise your budget or make a commitment to spend less

If Correct: That's correct! Any differences in your actual financial situation and your budget should be looked at each month.

###Specialized Budgets###

#Specialized Budgets
You can have one comprehensive budget for your whole financial situation: Most of these lessons have described how to do that. You should also know that you can set up budgets for specific things.

For example, you can have a travel budget which can keep you spending smartly while on vacation. You can also have budgets for specific projects.

Capital budgets are used for keeping you on track to reach long-term objectives. For example, you may have a budget for education, which keeps track of how much you need to earn, though work or through investment earnings, to afford it. Retirement is another area in which capital budgets are used. Learn more about saving and investing for education and retirement.

        <h2>Spend Smarter</h2>
        <p>Like we covered before, budgets exist to help you achieve goals. While we don’t say spending on one thing over another is inherently good or bad, we do want to point out ways to save and spend smarter on the things we do every day. </p>
<p>We often overspend because of things like social pressure and media glamorization of consumption. Do not let these outside influences dictate your goals: Make your goals your own.</p>

      <div id="no2" style="display: none;"><h2>Facts and Tips</h2>
        <p>Small ticket items can add up over time and it’s hard to keep track of them. Probably the most common example is buying a $4 coffee each day. If purchased every week day for a year, this can add to over $1000 year. Of course, maybe spending on a coffee each day brings you great benefit and is not something you want to cut out of your budget, and that’s perfectly fine. The only things to realize is that such items do indeed cost more than spending on cheaper alternatives (in this case, brewing coffee at home) and that to afford this you will have to give up spending on something else (the opportunity cost of buying coffee each day).</p>

<p>For <strong>entertainment</strong>, try to find cheaper alternatives and substitutes to what you normally do. In addition, limiting any alcohol consumption often can save you money given its relatively high cost.</p>
<p>Try to limit <strong>electric, gas, and water consumption</strong>. The old advice to turn down the air conditioning in the summer and turn down the heater in the winter are good starts. </p>

<p>When purchasing a <strong>car</strong>, consider a used one, as they are much cheaper than buying one new. Remember to factor in maintenance costs in you consideration, as a dirt cheap car may require more maintenance and have a shorter life than a slightly more expensive used car.</p>

<p>For <strong>trips and vacations</strong>, check different departure and arrival dates to find the cheapest. Also check different airlines and different airports, as some are cheaper than others. Beware of hidden fees, especially on airlines. While the fare may be low, the additional baggage costs may not make the discount worth it. For certain fare classes (often called basic economy), you will not be refunded or rebooked if you miss your flight.</p>

<p><strong>Clothes</strong> are often marked down at the end of the fashion cycle. If you are not obsessed with following each trend in fashion, waiting for these deeper discounts is a wise move.</p>

  <p>Shop around as much as you can for deals; you don’t have to visit every single store in the area for the absolute cheapest price, but a little comparing may save a good amount of money. With the internet, comparing prices is easier than ever, but many of us just purchase an item or service from the first place we see (especially on search engines, where ads are often placed first, even though they may not have the best price). </p>
  <p>If you use a certain item a lot, consider buying in bulk. Even though each purchase is a larger amount, the per-item cost is often lower.</p>
<p>For sales, pay attention only to sales price, not the original price. If the sales price is still to expensive for you, do not buy it, even if it is nominally marked down by a high percentage.</p>

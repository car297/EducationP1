        <h2>Gather Information</h2>
        <p>The first step to creating a budget is to figure out where to get information for tracking your finances. </p>
<p>For example, recent pay stubs may be a good way to get information about your income. Bank and credit card statements are good places to keep track of your expenses.</p>
<p>Past tax returns can give you information about their yearly income as well as give them an idea of what tax deductions and credits they may have (or not have) in the following year.</p>
<p>Keeping track of receipts is a good way to keep track of purchases, especially cash purchases, though this can become tedious to sort and keep track of. Often it can be ok to estimate cash transactions.</p>

         <div id="no2" style="display: none;"><h2>Starting a Budget</h2>
      <p>Once you have some idea of how you are spending your money, you can begin setting aside money for major expenses. Make sure to set aside funds for your biggest expenses (e.g. your mortgage payment, rent, car payment, utilities, student loans or tuition, etc.). </p>
<p>Next allocate (set aside) money for other, less important things. For example, how much do you want to spend on eating out this month (versus buying and cooking food)? How much do you want to spend on entertainment? Following sections will have tips on deciding how much to spend on different categories; not necessarily how much you should spend on a particular category but tips on how to spend smarter.</p>
<p>You should also decide how much you want to save or invest (more on that later).</p>

 <div id="no3" style="display: none;"><h2>Types of Income and Expenses</h2>
    <p>There are many types of income and expenses. For example:</p>
<strong>Income</strong>
<ul>
<li>From jobs that provide salaries. Employers give their employees W2 forms after each year showing how much they made and how much was withheld for taxes. </li>
<li>From self-employment. Money made from working but not for a formal employer are considered independent contractors. Income from this is still liable for taxes (often more than traditional work, as you must pay both the employer and employee portions of the FICA tax). Any client that pays you more than $600 during the year must provide you a Form 1099-MISC, which details how much the client paid you for your services https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/irs-tax-forms/what-is-an-irs-1099-form/L3NxSPMUe
</li>
<li>Investment income. You may earn money from the selling a stock or bond, or you may earn interest or dividend income from an investment.
<li>Gifts</li>
<li>Legal judgments and settlements</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some of these income streams, such as gifts and settlements are often non-recurring and relying on these streams for paying expenses, many of which are recurring, can get you into financial hot water.</p>
<p><strong>Expenses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Shelter expenses, or where you live. This can be your rent, or if you own a home, your mortgage, maintenance costs, property taxes, and other ownership costs.</li>
<li>Transportation costs, or how you get from one place to another. If you own a car, this may be your car payment, car registration fees, auto insurance, etc. If you do not own a car, this may be public transportation costs (e.g. bus passes, subway fares, train tickets), taxi and rideshare services (e.g. Uber and Lyft), or gas money for those your carpool with. This category can also include money spent on transportation during trips, especially if you take them regularly (e.g. flights, rental cars, train tickets).</li>
<li>Utilities, or recurring services that provide necessities or other desired items. These include electricity, water, and gas. Their costs are based on usage during the period (e.g. you are charged for electricity by kilowatt hour and for water by liter).</li>
<li>Recurring services such as internet, phone, and cable, like utilities, recur every period. Some services cost the same each period (e.g. many internet plans), and some can be usage-based  (e.g. a phone plan charging per gigabyte of mobile data used).</li>
<li>Food. Food can be cooked yourself (purchasing ingredients from grocery stores, farmers’ markets, etc.), or be purchased ready made by restaurants.</li>
<li>Entertainment, or things you spend on to have fun. These can include theater tickets, movie rentals, video games, going to bars, etc.</li>
<li>Clothing</li>
<li>Insurance, such as life insurance and disability insurance.</li>
<li>Medical expenses, such as health insurance premiums, co-pays, deductibles, and any other out-of-pocket expenses.</li>
<li>Loan repayments, or paying back what you borrowed plus the interest charged. These can include student loans, personal loans, and credit card payments (especially those for which you do not pay off the balance each month). Home mortgages and car payments are usually put under the housing and transportation categories respectively. </li>
<li>Taxes, such as federal income and FICA taxes (used to pay for Social Security and Medicare benefits). These are often already taken out of your paycheck each month.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Savings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rainy day fund, or savings to hold you over during a period with no or reduced income (e.g. job loss) or with a major, often unplanned expenses (e.g. medical injury). </li>
<li>Specific savings goals, including a vacation, education, retirement, etc.</li>
</ul>

<div id="no4" style="display: none;"><h2>Consider Opportunity Costs</h2>
       <p>When you’re making a budget, you should be aware that setting aside money for one thing takes away money from something else. This is called an opportunity cost: the lost benefit of something when you choose its alternative. For example, if you budget more money for food each month, that’s less money you can spend on entertainment. In addition, you can invest your money in the stock market, but you may not be able to access that money quickly if you need it (related to a concept known as liquidity). </p>
<p>Every allocation decision has an opportunity cost. You should work to maximize your net benefits when budgeting: your total satisfaction minus the total opportunity costs.</p>

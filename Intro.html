        <h2>What is a Budget?</h2>
        <p>A budget is a plan to spend your money. It is based on how much money you make (income, or money in), how much you spend (expenses, or money out), and how much you save (savings, or money for later). Budgets can be detailed or broad, comprehensive or specific to a certain area of your financial life.</p> <p>
There are many ways to create a budget: You can make one on paper, use spreadsheets, create one through software (such as through Liquify), or have one professional managed for you.</p>

      <div id="no2" style="display: none;"><h2>Creating a Budget</h2>
        <p>The first step to creating a budget is to figure out where to get information for tracking your finances. 
For example, recent pay stubs may be a good way to get information about your income. Bank and credit card statements are good places to keep track of your expenses.
Past tax returns can give you information about their yearly income as well as give them an idea of what tax deductions and credits they may have (or not have) in the following year.
Keeping track of receipts is a good way to keep track of purchases, especially cash purchases, though this can become tedious to sort and keep track of. Often it can be ok to estimate cash transactions.

Starting a budget 
Once you have some idea of how you are spending your money, you can begin setting aside money for major expenses. Make sure to set aside funds for your biggest expenses (e.g. your mortgage payment, rent, car payment, utilities, student loans or tuition, etc.). 
Next allocate (set aside) money for other, less important things. For example, how much do you want to spend on eating out this month (versus buying and cooking food)? How much do you want to spend on entertainment? Following sections will have tips on deciding how much to spend on different categories; not necessarily how much you should spend on a particular category but tips on how to spend smarter.
You should also decide how much you want to save or invest (more on that later).

        <h2>Adjusting Your Budget</h2><p>Compare actual to budgeted
After each period, you need to compare your budget to your actual spending for the period. More than likely, your actual spending will not line up with your budgeted amount. Once your first budget period is over, you should go back to see how well you did in meeting your budget goals.
In some categories, you may have overspent in some categories, while in others you may have underspent.
[GRAPHIC?]
In addition, you may have received more income than expected (a favorable thing), or received less (unfavorable). If you’re income is unpredictable and varies by a large amount each period, you experience income volatility (don’t worry too much, there are things you can do to help with that!)
Decide how to adjust
Once you know how your actual spending compares to your budgeted amounts, you should think about whether your budgeted amounts are appropriate to your current financial situation. If they are, then you should work to keep your spending in that range for the next period. If not, adjust your budget to your needs and goals.
For example, if you budgeted $150 for electricity each month but only spent $110 in the last, it may make sense to adjust the budget to a lower amount for the future, especially if you believe your last month’s electric consumption is typical of your electric consumption. 
In contrast, if you spent $200 on entertainment when you budgeted only $100, you should probably examine your spending habits a little more closely. It may be that you think $200 per month is better to spend on entertainment than $100, but you need to find other areas of spending to cut back on. 
There are ways to help you stay within your budgeted amounts, such as setting up notifications for when you near your spending limit, putting aside the amount you budget in cash in an envelope and only paying out of that (aka the envelope method), you adding all transactions manually.

      <div id="no4"><h2>Controlling Overspending</h2><p>Spend Smarter
Like we covered before, budgets exist to help you achieve goals. While we don’t say spending on one thing over another is inherently good or bad, we do want to point out ways to save and spend smarter on the things we do every day.
We often overspend because of things like social pressure and media glamorization of consumption. Do not let these outside influences dictate your goals: Make your goals your own.
Facts and Tips
Small ticket items can add up over time and it’s hard to keep track of them. Probably the most common example is buying a $4 coffee each day. If purchased every week day for a year, this can add to over $1000 year. Of course, maybe spending on a coffee each day brings you great benefit and is not something you want to cut out of your budget, and that’s perfectly fine. The only things to realize is that such items do indeed cost more than spending on cheaper alternatives (in this case, brewing coffee at home) and that to afford this you will have to give up spending on something else (the opportunity cost of buying coffee each day).
Subscriptions can add up quickly, and often times we do not even use what we are paying for (and even sometimes forget we have them). Check regularly to see if there are any subscriptions you can cancel.
For entertainment, try to find cheaper alternatives and substitutes to what you normally do. In addition, limiting any alcohol consumption often can save you money given its relatively high cost.
Try to limit electric, gas, and water consumption. The old advice to turn down the air conditioning in the summer and turn down the heater in the winter are good starts. 
Shop around as much as you can for deals; you don’t have to visit every single store in the area for the absolute cheapest price, but a little comparing may save a good amount of money. With the internet, comparing prices is easier than ever, but many of us just purchase an item or service from the first place we see (especially on search engines, where ads are often placed first, even though they may not have the best price). 
When purchasing a car, consider a used one, as they are much cheaper than buying one new. Remember to factor in maintenance costs in you consideration, as a dirt cheap car may require more maintenance and have a shorter life than a slightly more expensive used car.
For trips and vacations, check different departure and arrival dates to find the cheapest. Also check different airlines and different airports, as some are cheaper than others. Beware of hidden fees, especially on airlines. While the fare may be low, the additional baggage costs may not make the discount worth it. For certain fare classes (often called basic economy), you will not be refunded or rebooked if you miss your flight.
If you use a certain item a lot, consider buying in bulk. Even though each purchase is a larger amount, the per-item cost is often lower.
For sales, pay attention only to sales price, not the original price. If the sales price is still to expensive for you, do not buy it, even if it is nominally marked down by a high percentage.
Clothes are often marked down at the end of the fashion cycle. If you are not obsessed with following each trend in fashion, waiting for these deeper discounts is a wise move.

      <div id="no5"><h2>Specialized Budgets</h2><p>You can have one comprehensive budget for your whole financial situation: Most of these lessons have described how to do that. You should also know that you can set up budgets for specific things. For example, you can have a travel budget which can keep you spending smartly while on vacation. You can also have budgets for specific projects.
Capital budgets are used for keeping you on track to reach long-term objectives. For example, you may have a budget for education, which keeps track of how much you need to earn, though work or through investment earnings, to afford it. Retirement is another area in which capital budgets are used.
